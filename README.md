# PrestaShop localization files

This repository contains the official localization files for PrestaShop.

## What's that?

Localization files specify which languages and currencies to install for a given country, as well as local taxes.

These files are bundled in packs and downloadable from your back office.

## Submitting changes

Once a Pull Request has been accepted in this repository, changes should be synchronized to the [main project's "localization" directory](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/tree/develop/localization) via Pull Request.

Embedding the localization files in the project allows users to benefit from localization files without having to download them.
